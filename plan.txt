Fishing Equipment:

Project Frameworks:

1. Backend:
 - Java Spring with Maven
 - SprinWeb 
 - Lombok
 - PostgreSQL database
 - In the future maybe Security

2. Frontend:
 - React with TypeScript (maybe with javascript if its too complicated)
 - React MUI
 - Most likely i will focus more on Backend (more favoured by myself)

Project Structure:

With the basic structure of Java spring will build up the project with the OOP priceples.
Will use the MVC system also so that it will be easier to follow the srtucture or to find.
There will be also repositories from the project gets the data.

I would like to build it up with a User model and with different fishing tool Models with repositories.
All routes with controllers and the needed services separetaly.


Roots:
- Login
- Register
- Profile
- Equipments
- Add new equipment 

Login & Reister:
Keep it as simple as possible with only the needed information with simple react MUI.

Profile:
Future plans:
Add picture and some basic data from the user (name, birth etc...)

Equipment:
I have to think about that deeper beacuse im a fisher but there are so many things to think of.

Add Equipment:
It will be a simple side where you can add your equimpent.
